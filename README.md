# Employee_Performance_Analysis
INX Company decided to initiate a data science project , which analyses the current employee data and find the core underlying causes of this performance issues. 
Mr. Brain, being a data scientist himself, expects the findings of this project will help him to take right course of actions. He also expects a clear indicators 
of non performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employee, if required, may not significantly affect other employee morals.

# Conclusion
As per the analysis of all the data using visualization tools Tableau. I can able to conclude that to increase the work performance of the employee, Company have to take care of following fee points. They are:<br>
    <ul><li>Company have to work on company environment which is not satisfied by the under performing employee which will help to boost the performance of employee.
    <li>The job satisfaction of many employee is not good, as per my view they didn’t get the post what they are talented on and also the employee relationship satisfaction is not good for that all employee have to give training to coordinate with team properly.
    <li>All most all the employee who are under performing don’t have better work life balance. So, company have to think about it.
    </ul>
This are the major point I got by analyzing the INX Company datasets to improve performance of employee.
